 * The bundled viewer source is run via *indirect* eval rather than by injecting a
 * <script> element. Indirect eval executes in the target window's global scope —
 * exactly like a top-level <script>, so the viewer's `var GraphViewer = …` becomes
 * `window.GraphViewer` — but creates no script element. The source is our own
 * vendored, offline-pinned drawio viewer (no external code is fetched or run; the
 * vendored blob's only external-script loader is stripped at build time).
